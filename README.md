# Game-of-Life
This project is far from perfect, but developing it further is a waste of time to me as it fullfilled its educational purpose. Mouse clicks arent accuarate, edges are buggy and the algorythm is not optimized. Still I think its a succesfull project.
# "How to play"
You can add points to the board by mouse-clicking on the canvas. If you want to start the game, just press space. You can quit by pushing escape.
